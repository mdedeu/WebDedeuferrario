							<h3>Why us?</h3>
							<p>From its inception Dedeu-Ferrario, Abogados, created a special department to help its foreign clients in the development of its business in Argentina. For information purposes you will find below some highlights of our activity in this field. <br> <br>One of our first cases back in the 70´s was the establishment of a local subsidiary of an important financial investment corporation. At that time, our firm aimed the company and its shareholders (originally more than 84 first class Banks and Industrial worldwide corporations) with the award of a number of government authorizations required for its operations in the region. <br> <br> In the oil and energy field our government affairs group worked closely with Compagnie Francaise d´Enterprise (CFM) in the selling of the first semi-submergible offshore rig to the former YPF state owned corporation providing one of the most important transactions made at that time between a foreign corporation and the Argentine Government, involving export credit financing and a multilateral contract in three different jurisdictions. <br><br>A similar case was done for the project finance structured for the construction and operation of a yellow cake uranium plant for the National Commission of Atomic Energy (CONEA) directed and managed by our clients Shipley & Co. (UK Bank) and a local corporation. <br><br>In the mid eighties, our attorneys obtained the Government approval for the establishment of the first private French owned company to operate both cargo and passenger flights, on a regular basis thus, breaking the national monopoly in hands at that time, of the state owned air-carrier Aerolineas Argentinas. <br><br>During the nineties, we were very active in the privatization of the oil and gas sector in Argentina and Bolivia acting as counsel for  international clients. In the energy field, we also represented a large Chilean group in the privatization of the Provincial power supply company in San Juan. Our group acquired its unique expertise in this field through our participation in the placement of an IPO for Central Puerto, Central Costanera and Transportadora de Gas del Sur. One of our member have participated in a number of deals specifically related to the Energy sector such as the selling of Central Guemes, Central San Nicolas S.A., Central Dique S.A., Hidroeléctrica Alicurá, Hidroeléctrica Planicie Banderita S.A. among others, to private investors. <br><br>Our success helping clients in the drafting of public policies providing strategic benefits is one of our greatest assets. In the mining field, we have drafted on behalf of the Entrepreneurial sector, the update of the Mining Investment Law, as well as the Mining Integration Treaty between Argentina and Chile. Within that Treaty we also worked, in the drafting of the international protocol concerning Pachon´s mining project. <br><br>In the telecommunication sector, we assisted international clients in different public auctions obtaining licenses such as a PCS B-band for the AMBA (Area Multiple Buenos Aires), or a DTH license for a local group. Also, we provided the necessary corporate assistance to important telecom clients such as America On Line (AOL Argentina).
